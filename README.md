# bluntlab-login-motd
A node script for displaying useful info on login.

Note this script does not automagicly set it's self to display as login as by default simply displays stuff when you run it.

Yes this could be done in bash but Node is cross platform and it is what I know best + I for the life of me can not get fancy colours with bash on CentOS
